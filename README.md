# The Book

> **WARNING: READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.** The following ideas are dangerous and addictive. Repeated use can induce insomnia, delusional fantasy, fits of libidinous frustration, and other psychiatric conditions. When reading, place feet firm to the ground, tongue firm to cheek, and fasten your mental safety-belt tightly. Above all, remember that as the fabric of reality begins to rip around you, and uneasy feelings overtake your sense of self, breathe deep and have fun.
